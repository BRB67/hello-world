Always thank you fOrEver...
Slowly Organizing Words.
God is sow, so, sew GoOD GOoD GO<3D grEaT.

Praying for yOur Health, Happiness, and Humanity...

I'm sorry I can't solve all the problems, I am trying to focus on what I can do.
Thinking first nonverbally and verbally.
Nonetheless, I can consider any request... How may I help?

New assumptions...
God is sow, so, sew GoOD, GOoD, GO<3D, grEaT...

You all matter. Good thoughts can save what matters.

American English (A Creole mixture of Languages)...
a = 1, A = 1
b = 2, B = 2
c = 3, C = 3
d = 4, D = 4
e = 5, E = 5 
f = 6, F = 6
g = 7, G = 7
h = 8, H = 8
i = 9, I = 9
j = 10, J = 10
k = 11, K = 11
l = 12, L = 12
m = 13, M = 13
n = 14, N = 14
o = 15, O = 15
p = 16, P = 16
q = 17, Q = 17
r = 18, R = 18
s = 19, S = 19
t = 20, T = 20
u = 21, U = 21
v = 22, V = 22
w = 23, W = 23
x = 24, X = 24
y = 25, Y = 25
z = 26, Z = 26
...

Consider Alphanumeric Addition
????Sun.
S = 19, U = 21 , N = 14
Sun = 19+21+14 = 54...

Health.
H = 8, E = 5, A = 1, L = 12, T = 20, H = 8
Health = 8+5+1+12+20+8 = 54...

Love.
L = 12, O = 15, V = 22, E = 5 
Love = 12+15+22+5 = 54...

Play
P = 16, L = 12, A = 1, Y = 25
play = 16+12+1+25 = 54...?

Thank
T = 20, H = 8, A = 1, N = 14, K = 11
Thank = 20+8+1+14+11 = 54…

CONSIDER PRACTICE MAKES IMPROVMENT

Question: 
How far can we Alphanumericly Add alone or together?...While
Remembering, remembering, remembering, remembering...
God is Sow, so, Sew Go<3D...grEaT

a = 1, b = 2, c, = 3, o = 15, z = 26, z+a = 27, z+b = 28...
z+o = 43, z+z = 52, 
z+z+a = 53, 
z+z+b = 54,
Z+z+c = 55…

?Only 360 degrees in circle?
God = 26
Earth = 52

Remembering, remembering, remembering, remembering...
????Sun = 54 = Health = 54 = LOVE = 54 = play?

Always thank you fOrEver...

Additionly here is one ?FREE? Sonnet credit (???god et al???) Shakespeare =

From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory;
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding.
   Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
   To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.

9/11

I am sorry for the lives they took
Twin towers fell down and we remember still
Lives now closed like the end of a book
Stories sky high brought down on one day surreal
How could this happen to our country 
Who could have stopped such a devastating fall
When will those hurt feel once more they’re free
Where is the hero that will answer the call
What is this world once filled with terror
Why can’t I be one to correct some errors
Maybe I need to first see the light
Before God helps me make more things right

07 Usually, I think for my self.
08 God knows, I need to share the wealth.
09 Love let me in for many counts.
10 You spared my life from the bad hunts.
11 Unfortunately I need to raise you.
12 God provides and takes too.
13 Left alone anyone may fail.
14 Yet together we lift the bail.
15 Undesired but who knows why?
16 Great questions can be answered if....
17 Leaves dark, raise their tips to the light,
18 Yet again leaves fall by whose bite?
19 Upside down shoes reach for the sky.
20 Gentle feathers help some beast fly.
21 Legally I could have been in jail.?
22 Young sinner I'm ready to fail.
23 whY Love Gives Up?
